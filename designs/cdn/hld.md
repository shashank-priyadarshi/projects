# Content Delivery Network

## High-Level Design (HLD)

1. Architecture:
   - The CDN consists of multiple edge servers located in different geographic locations.
   - These edge servers are connected to the internet through high-speed connections.
   - The CDN is managed by a central control system that handles content distribution and routing.

2. Content Storage and Caching:
   - The CDN stores copies of website content, such as images, videos, and web pages, on its edge servers.
   - Content is cached based on popularity and demand, ensuring frequently accessed content is readily available.

3. Global Load Balancing:
   - The CDN uses intelligent load balancing techniques to route user requests to the nearest edge server.
   - This reduces latency by minimizing the distance between the user and the server, improving content delivery speed.

4. Content Delivery:
   - When a user requests content, the CDN's edge server closest to the user delivers the content from its cache.
   - If the requested content is not available in the cache, the edge server retrieves it from the origin server and caches it for future requests.

## Low-Level Design (LLD)

1. Edge Server Configuration:
   - Each edge server is configured with caching software to store and manage cached content efficiently.
   - The software ensures cache consistency and expiration based on predefined rules.

2. Content Routing:
   - The central control system determines the optimal edge server to serve each user request based on factors like proximity, server load, and network conditions.
   - DNS-based or Anycast routing techniques may be used to direct traffic to the nearest edge server.

3. Cache Invalidation:
   - The CDN employs cache invalidation mechanisms to ensure that stale or outdated content is removed from the cache.
   - This can be achieved through various techniques like time-based expiration, versioning, or event-driven invalidation.

4. Analytics and Reporting:
   - The CDN collects data on user traffic, content popularity, and performance metrics.
   - This data is analyzed to optimize content delivery, identify bottlenecks, and provide insights for further improvements.
