**Each project idea will allow you to explore different aspects of backend development, including API design, authentication, data processing, scalability, and performance optimization. Letâ€™s delve into the details of each project:**
**Note: You can build any of these projects in different framework or language.**

- Text based read log
  - Should allow entry of books currently being read, wishlist, books read
  - Configurable alarm, and whatsapp message to record page number of books currently being read, throw reminders for spaced repetitions of read books
  - Should remember day wise data entered
  - Should provide API to fetch all data

- Integrated note taking

- URL storage & renderer

- RESTful API with Authentication and Authorization: Develop a RESTful API using frameworks like Express or Django, incorporating authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the endpoints.

- Task Scheduling and Background Jobs with a Job Queue: Implement a task scheduling system using a job queue like Bull or RabbitMQ, allowing asynchronous execution of tasks and background job processing.

- Real-time Chat Application with WebSockets: Build a real-time chat application using WebSockets and frameworks like Socket.io or Django Channels, enabling instant messaging between users.

- Microservices Architecture with Communication Protocols: Design and implement a microservices architecture using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, and establish communication between services using REST APIs or message brokers.

- Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Distributed Systems: Build a distributed system that can handle high traffic and ensure fault tolerance by leveraging technologies like Apache Kafka, Apache Cassandra, or Redis.

- Building a Content Delivery Network (CDN): Create a CDN using technologies like Nginx or Varnish Cache to efficiently deliver static assets and improve the performance of web applications.

- Implementing a Caching Layer for Performance Optimization: Integrate caching mechanisms like Redis or Memcached into your backend system to cache frequently accessed data and enhance application performance.

- Designing and Optimizing Relational Database Schemas: Develop a database schema for a complex domain, optimizing queries, relationships, and indexing strategies to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage.

- Building a Web Scraping and Data Processing Service: Create a service that collects data from web sources using tools like Scrapy or Puppeteer, and process and store the data in a structured format.

- Creating an Analytics Dashboard with Data Visualization: Build an analytics dashboard using frameworks like React or Angular, integrating with data visualization libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to provide insightful data representations.
